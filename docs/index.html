          <h1>Charles Lesser</h1>
          <p>Hello! I'm an undergraduate studying Computer Science Game Design and Applied Mathematics at UC Santa Cruz. I'm specializing in game design and Unity based development. Currently, I am a research assistant at the <a href="https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu">Social Emotional Technology Lab</a> where I prototype novel VR interfaces.</p>

          <h3>Arcana (2024)</h3>
          <p>Arcana is a card-battler that uses tarot cards to play. It was originally made for a college project, but ended up as a very solid game by the end of its development. This project used everything I knew about Unity so far, but I took it one step further to make sure that each of the features were coded via C# script and in such a way that it is replicable over many different maps, enemy types, dungeons, etc. It is currently in continued development.</p>

          <h3>Ghili Suit (2024)</h3>
          <p>Ghili Suit was made in unity for the UCSC 2024 Computational Media Game Jam. It's a 2D stealth game, where the player must solve the puzzle of each room to take out the target, which were based on quotes from various franchises. From this project, I perfected the Unity input system, and made an inventory system that could dynamically collect items the player found.</p>

          <h3>Tavernkeep (2024)</h3>
          <p>Tavernkeep is a text-based Twine game originally made for college, but evolved into much more. It utilizes an immense amount of branches to tell the story of a small business owner in a fantasy world, and the challenges that come with it. This project was a narrative powerhouse, and helped me refine my creative writing in games.</p>

          <h2>The "Islands" Series</h2>
          <p>My tool for learning new systems - I create the next installment in this simple series when I want to learn a new system. It doubles as a joke and a project-based learning tool where I create the same game in different engines. It is also abandoned once I feel comfortable with the system, so most are unfinished.</p>

          <h3>Islands VR (2023)</h3>
         <p>The SET Lab at UCSC required me to learn oculus VR development in Unity, as well as the photon multiplayer service. These two completely changed how the engine worked, so I had to relearn from scratch. This resulted in the very incomplete Islands VR, which helped me work with the multiplayer data stream, VR interaction, and PunEvents.</p>

          <h3>Islands 2 (2021)</h3>
          <p>Islands 2 wasn't my first foray into Unity, but it marked the most dedicated and complete. I took everything I had made in Islands 1 and completely recreated it in Unity. This time, I added more graphics and animations. As a result, I gained a good understanding of Unity as an engine.</p>

          <h3>Islands (2019)</h3>
          <p>Islands was created in my freshman year of high school to help learn Java for AP CSA. It was a button based clicker, accumilating resources to then spend on various things, including going to the next island. It helped me master Java, and by extension, C#.</p>
